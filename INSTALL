Installation instructions
-------------------------

At this moment there are no binary distributions available, you need to compile
from sources.

Before doing anything else, please install the following components:

1. CRASH can be obtained from http://people.redhat.com/anderson
2. Python programming language with runtime libraries, http://www.python.org


All these tools have licenses compatible with GPL and can be downloaded from
sites referenced above. They are usually included in Linux distributions, but
you still _need_ to compile 'crash' from sources as we need to link against it.
You _need_ to compile Python from sources as different versions of Python are
not bytecode-compatible and to make module as portable as possible, we copy
all needed Python components to the module itself.

Compiling CRASH
---------------

Download a recent version from URL above and unpack it. Please use crash-5.X or
crash-6.X, we do not support older versions anymore.

After that do 'make' and copy the resulting binary to a directory in your PATH,
e.g. /usr/local/bin. We recommend to rename the resulting executable to
'crash32' on 32-bit platforms and to 'crash64' on 64-bit platforms. The reason
for that is that it is possible to analyze both 32-bit and 64-bit dumps on AMD64
- but you need different crash executables for that (crash32 compiled for
32-bits and crash64 compiled for 64 bits)

WARNING: it seems that 'crash' makefiles are not written very cleanly - if
you interrupt compilation process with ^C and start 'make' again, it
sometime fails.

Installing Python
-----------------

All modern distributions usually include Python. But you still need to compile
it from sources. Python-2.6 and later should be fine; we recommend to use
the latest version of Python-2.7.


Installing Pykdump
------------------

After unpacking the distribution, compile the extension. To do this,
go to Extension subdirectory and configure it using the configure script.
NOTE: this is not an autoconf script, but a hand crafted script for
pykdump.  You must specify three directories:  the crash build directory,
the python source directory and the python build directory (if different
from the source directory), thus:

  ./configure -c ${CRASHBLDDIR} -p ${PYTHONBLDDIR}

After that run 'make', this should create pykdump32.so file (on a 32-bit
X86) or pykdump64.so on AMD64 running 64-bits. After that you can copy this
file to a directory of your choice or do 'make install' to install it in
/usr/local/lib

Edit your ~/.crashrc file and add a line to load this module automatically.
Note: the name of this initialization file is derived from the name of 'crash'
executables, so for crash32 it will be .crash32rc, for crash64 .crash64rc.
This makes it possible to use different initializations for 32-bit and 64-bit
executables.

After extension is compiled/installed, go to top directory of Pykdump unpacked
distribution and run 'python setup.py install' - this will install Pykdump
package in site-packages/.

If you have several versions of Python installed on your host, you can specify
the needed version in the following way:

For compiling the extension, do something like

{asid 16:13:57} make PYTHON=python2.5
gcc -pthread -c -fPIC -DX86 -I/src/kerntools/crash-4.0-3.12 -I/usr/include/python2.5 epython.c -o epython.o
gcc -pthread -c -fPIC -DX86 -I/src/kerntools/crash-4.0-3.12 -I/usr/include/python2.5 functions.c -o functions.o
gcc -pthread -nostartfiles -shared   -nostartfiles -shared -Xlinker -export-dynamic  epython.o functions.o -o pykdump32.so  -lpthread -ldl  -lutil -L. -lpython2.5 -lm


For installing Python Pykdump module, do

{asid 16:14:34} python2.5 setup.py install
...
